# Design Login page

Using HTML, CSS, and JS, a login page has been implemented both vertically and horizontally in the middle of the page.

For implementation, the following are observed:
1. Responsive design
2. The entered e-mail is validated; if the e-mail is not valid, an error is shown to the user.
3. User will be notified of an error if the entered password does not contain at least eight characters.
